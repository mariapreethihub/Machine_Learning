Breast Cancer Classification
#1. Overview
This project aims to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset available in scikit-learn.
The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of breast mass FNA (fine needle aspirate) tests, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and more.
Multiple classification algorithms are built and evaluated to determine which model performs best in diagnosing breast cancer.

#2. Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Dataset from the sklearn.datasets module.
It contains 30 numeric features and a target.


#3. Steps Involved
1. Loading the Data
a.Loaded the dataset using load_breast_cancer() from sklearn
b.Converted to a pandas DataFrame for ease of analysis

2. Feature Selection based on Correlation
a.Calculated correlation of all features with the target
b.Dropped features with correlation < 0.1
c.Removed features with high inter-correlation (correlation > 0.9) to reduce redundancy

3. Data Preprocessing
a. Missing Values: Checked using isnull().sum(). None found
b. Duplicates: Verified there were no duplicate rows
c. Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize the features
d. Splitting: Data split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split()

4. Model Building
Implemented the following classification algorithms:
 a.Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification
 b.Decision Tree Classifier: Tree-based model that splits data into rules
 c.Random Forest Classifier: Ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy
 d.Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Finds optimal boundary with max margin
 e.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on nearest data points

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated all models using the following classification metrics:
a.Accuracy
b Precision
c.Recall
d.F1-score

These help in assessing how well each model detects cancer correctly and minimizes false results.

6. Results
All models performed well, with Logistic Regression showing the highest accuracy and F1-score
Decision Tree had slightly lower performance, possibly due to overfitting.

Summary table of results was generated and printed for comparison

Best model: Logistic Regression (based on accuracy & F1-score)
Worst model: Decision Tree (relatively lower metrics)

#4. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how classification models can be used for early breast cancer detection.
Using correlation analysis and model evaluation techniques, we improved model performance and selected the best approach.
Such machine learning models can be used for faster diagnosis and more accurate decisions.
