Key factors for Car Pricing in US Market
#1. Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the price of cars in the American market
based on various independent variables. The model will identify and quantify the factors that significantly impact car 
prices, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions for designing cars, setting competitive prices, and tailoring 
business strategies for their US market entry. By understanding the relationship between car pricing and key variables, 
the company will be equipped to optimize their offerings and approach to maximize success in a new market.

#2. Dataset
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link
It contains 24 features and a target variable.

#3. Steps Involved
1. Loading the Data

2. Feature Selection based on Correlation
a.Calculated correlation of all features with the target
b.Dropped features with correlation < 0.1
c.Removed features with high inter-correlation (correlation > 0.9).

3. Data Preprocessing
a. Missing Values: Checked using isnull().sum(). None found
b. Duplicates: Verified there were no duplicate rows
c. Feature Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize the features
d. Splitting: Data split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split()

4. Model Building
Implemented the following classification algorithms:
a.Linear Regression: A basic algorithm that models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables by
fitting a straight line that minimizes the prediction error.

b.Decision Tree Regressor: A tree-based model that splits the data into branches based on feature values to make predictions 
by averaging outcomes in each leaf.

c.Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions 
to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

d.Gradient Boosting Regressor: A powerful ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects 
the errors of the previous ones.

e.Support Vector Regressor (SVR): A regression algorithm that tries to fit the best line within a margin of tolerance while 
maximizing the flatness of the model.

5. Model Evaluation
Evaluated all models using the following classification metrics:
a.R2 Score
b MSE
c.MAE

6. Results
Based on the analysis, it is clear that variables like engine size, curb weight, and horsepower (correlation matrix)have
the strongest influence on car pricing in the US market. There are no significant outliers in the dataset.However the target
variable was slighlty right skewed because of outliers and issue is addressed.

The Random Forest Regressor is the best performance model with an RÂ² of 0.94,suggesting that our model explains 
over 90% of the variation in car prices. These insights can guide the Chinese manufacturerin designing vehicles 
that meet American preferences and pricing expectations.
