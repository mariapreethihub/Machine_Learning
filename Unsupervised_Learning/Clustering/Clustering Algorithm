# Iris Dataset Clustering - KMeans & Hierarchical Clustering

## Objective

This notebook demonstrates clustering techniques on the Iris dataset using:

- KMeans Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering

## Dataset

- Dataset: Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets
- Features in the dataset :sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

1️. KMeans Clustering

- KMeans partitions data into `k` clusters based on distance to centroids.
- Iris dataset has clear feature separation, making it ideal for cluster-based grouping.

**Steps**
  - Used Elbow method to choose optimal `k`
  - Applied KMeans
  - Visualized clusters using seaborn

2️. Hierarchical Clustering

- Builds a tree of clusters by merging closest pairs.It is ideal for small datasets and visual cluster exploration with dendrogram.

**Steps**
  - Used scipy to generate dendrogram
  - Applied Agglomerative Clustering 
  - Visualized final clusters



---

## ✅ Outcome

- Both clustering methods successfully grouped the data.
- Plots show meaningful separations, especially using petal-based features.
